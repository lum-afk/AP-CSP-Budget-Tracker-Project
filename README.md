budget tracker program to record, categorize, and analyze a user's finances and to store expenses

Hello!
Welcome to my budget tracker 

This project was initially developed for the AP Computer Science Principles course but I later found to be useful in tracking daily expenditures

Feel free to use the code to your liking <3

Features include:
- Add and track income and expenses
- Categorize financial expenses (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment)
- View current balance
- Summarize total income and expenses
